# So You Want to Build a Quantum Ledger?
### A Hands-On Guide with Qiskit (v0.1)

Look, my main work ([Dimensional Collapse Theory (DCT-QG)](https://github.com/MarcusSkynet/dct-qg) if you're fancy) says that black hole singularities are a myth. It says they're replaced by a 2D, quantum "Ledger" that processes information.

Sounds like a wild story, right?

This repository is where I put my money where my mouth is. It's a Jupyter Notebook that builds a working, simulated model of that very Ledger using Qiskit. No hand-waving, just quantum circuits.

### What's Inside the Box:

*   The actual circuit for a single "tile" of the ledger, built from a holographic error-correcting code.
*   A working model of the "Snap"—the moment information gets written to the ledger.
*   A circuit-level implementation of the "Infinity Bits"—the geometric settings that program the local physics.
*   Code that stitches these tiles together into a real, entangled network.

This isn't just a toy. It's the microscopic engine room of a new theory of gravity. Feel free to run it, break it, and see for yourself if the logic holds.

### Licensing (The Important Bit)

This is free, open-source software under the **GPLv3 license**. That means you can use it, share it, and build upon it for your own research, no strings attached. Go wild.

**The Not-So-Free Part:**
If you're a company and you think you can take this architecture, slap it into your proprietary quantum computer, and make a billion dollars... well, first of all, I like your style. Second, you need to talk to me about a **commercial license.**

My research runs on curiosity and coffee, not just goodwill. Let's chat: `marek@tidesofuncertainty.com`.
